## 📌 **Project Title**
# **Real-Time IoT-Based Environmental Monitoring & Weather Prediction System**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

There is a significant lack of **localized, real-time weather prediction systems** that rely on **live environmental sensor data**.  
Traditional weather forecasts do not utilize **on-site parameters** such as:

- 🌡️ *Temperature*  
- 💧 *Humidity*  
- 🌫️ *Air Quality*

As a result, predictions are often generalized and not tailored to local micro-climates.

## 🎯 **Objective**

To design and develop a **smart IoT-based weather prediction system** that:

- Uses **ESP32** to collect live environmental data  
- Integrates **DHT11** (temperature + humidity) and **MQ135** (air quality) sensors  
- Sends real-time readings to a **Flask-based Machine Learning API**  
- Predicts **next-day weather conditions**  
- Displays data and predictions on a **live visualization dashboard**
